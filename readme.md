### Paths

##### Current User's Home Folder
```/Users/cchapman/ ``` is the same as ```~```

##### Absolute Paths
The entire path from the root ```/``` of your hard drive to the folder you are targeting. 
Example:```/users/cchapman/Desktop/Zero_to_Git```

##### Relative Paths
```./``` or ```.``` prefix for Relative path. Means "My current working directory."
```shell
cd ./Desktop
```

##### Parent Directory
To access the parent Dir use the ```..``` to reference it.

Example:

```shell 
cd ..			# Goes to the Parent Folder (directory)
## Be Careful
```shell
rm /
```
